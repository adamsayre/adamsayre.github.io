# Not as bad as I expected

I've read this book before. Well, not this one but it's close enough to a slew of other books as makes no difference.

They're all pretty much the same. Shlubby male protag gets an inheritance thats a blessing and a curse, given and explained throughout by a hot female sidekick. She's sexy, competent, and sexy again. Hero gets a bit of a crush on her, goofs in her general direction for the length of the book, and hey presto there's a romance subplot!

So I was surprised when Charlie didn't even go after his hot female sidekick. And surprised when the hot sidekick was portrayed as competent, sexy, and competent. She often tells the protagonist that she's got other things going on, and he doesn't pry into her private life!

Another staple of the "boy meets grandpa/uncle/father's secret business" genre is a bunch of cool and strange rivals for the Boy to pit himself against.

I was also surprised with Scalzi's treatment of that, he portrays the other crime bosses as incompetent losers, pretty clearly drawing a line between them and real life losers like Zuck and Elon.

We also get a little hit about the dying journalism industry, right out of the gate, too. That's fine, more publicity for how stupid American society is at the moment.

My only critism is that this book shirks almost every trope of the golden nepo boy genre except the one where the protag is super competent! Politically, Charlie is as smart as they get. He's no good in a fight, but that's part of the genre too.

It's okay, overall. Scalzi criticizes the genre while also criticizing the world we live in.
