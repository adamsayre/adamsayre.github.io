A fascinating book that gets ethereal and disjointed at the end.

I think it's not an accident that the book becomes a little unmoored as it continues. It reflect's Fetter's journey of starting with an unstructured life, finding some piece or permanency in the city and then continues to reject that permanency as his destiny catches up with him. Fetter is a very detailed person and is a lovely examination of a child of flawed parenting, and his story is set in an interesting place with strange histories and stranger rules. 

Things get explained better towards the end, but once he got arrested I found it harder to continue. Not impossible just more difficult!

Spoiler on a detail that i thought was fascinating: There's a brief mention of tents that are "United Nations blue" - was that directed at the reader, or is Vajra implying that this is a futuristic version of earth?
