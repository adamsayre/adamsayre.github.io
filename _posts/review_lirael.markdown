# Sam is Annoying and That's Okay 

I think it's an interesting twist to have a POV character be as annoying, cowardly, and ineffective as Sam. Especially since these books are filled with other characters that reflect varying levels of competence and confidence. Lirael is an interesting contrast to this character, she's got low confidence but high competence. And that's further opposed to Sabriel in book 1, with low competence and medium to high confidence. I think Sam's a logical extension of this exploration of characters and I appreciate that he's not the typical "spoiled prince" or "scared little boy" archetype.

Garth is quite fond of little idioms or sayings being part of the books (see "Does the walker choose the pathâ€¦" from the first book) and this book is no exception (one of them from this book is saved in my highlights). In this book's case I feel that I dont understand its connection to the plot. Perhaps the meaning is too deep or too obscured, perhaps Garth wanted to avoid a more obvious saying. Either way, it went over my head and felt a little too much like i was gazing at my own navel to spend more time trying to connect it. The path and the walker quote from Sabriel was fine in that I could find a surface-level connection to Sabriel's battle with her Abhorsen Destiny and following in her father's footsteps. But deeper connection to the characters escaped me, if there was one (I couldn't help but feel that there was since it was brought up so much).

One thing that I wish the book did better was to explore the fact that your mistakes or decisions as a child don't completely determine who you are as an adult. Perhaps we'll see this with Future Sam and Future Lirael but in this book both are children who are in dangerous situations, who make decisions they may not live to regret. I feel they're "stuck" with those choice just like other children in fantasy literature. These coming of age stories often center around finding your "true path" and this book felt like it was doing just that.

I suppose I wish there were more stories about children who don't have it all figured out. It strikes me as ironic since Sam's story was very much centered around this tension of the things he had "figured out" and revising that pre-planned destiny.

Not laying anything at Garth's feet here, it's a twenty-plus year old book so the genre was in a different place then. We've had a lot of coming-of-age stories since then, and my criticism of it as a genre is likely driven from that context.
