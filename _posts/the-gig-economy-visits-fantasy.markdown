# The Gig Economy Visits Fantasy

"So, friend, you wanna be a warlock? Well the warlockery of Hrum offers the best services a potential warlock can receive!" drones the Indoctrination Superintendent, whose title was only known because someone told Varo earlier. A triangular sign rested on the table between them and Varo. Varo didn't know what it says, but assumed it said Indoctrination Superintendent. 

Varo nodded, not sure what else to say.

"Fine, just fine," the superintendent (whose name is still a mystery) slid a sheaf of papers across the way to Varo. "Read this and then let me know if you agree to it."

Varo was directed to a chair among a group against a wall. The entrance they had come through into this office was dark, grimy, and dripping with mysterious liquid. Precisely what one would expect when signing up to be a warlock. The office itself was clean, brightly lit, and dry of any liquid. Precisely what one wouldn't expect of an indoctrination office.

Varo idly flipped through pages of the sheaf, which seemed a well-worn and yellowing around the edges sort of sheaf. Words floated (figuratively) off the page and past Varo, deflected by Varo's incomprehension of this language.

They take a moment to watch the goings on of the office. A few people come in, dropped pieces of paper on the Superintendent's desk, and a few others come and take other papers away. The Superintendent seems to be largely unaware of these papers, engrossed instead in a page that glows with a soft light that illuminates their face. 

After a few dozen minutes of paper comings and goings, Varo concludes they're largely useless. They're pretty sure they saw a few of the same papers twice, maybe three times. Varo also concludes that they've spent enough time "reading" the sheaf and can reapproach the Superintendent, who nods at them, retrieves the sheaf, and presents Varo with the glowing paper they were working on before.

"If you agree to the terms presented in the document, sign your name or make your mark here" the Superintendent points at a line at the bottom of the page. Varo does, and the signs and symbols on the sheet rearrange themselves into a more recognizable form, or at least some of them do.

"Choose your preferred written language," droned the Superintendent, eyes deep in another glowing paper. 

Varo selected the one that they recognize most of the letters of. They'd been speaking a common enough tongue, but written language was a world all of its own. A world that Varo hadn't much visited.

The page rearranged again to say *Welcome! Something something* A large-eyed smiling animal grins from behind the words. Varo didn't recognize it.

"Thank you for your service, please make sure to provide a review of your experience on the next page," the Superintendent reached across the table and brushes the parchment. 

*Please rate something something* (and then a string of characters Varo doesn't recognize). Below were arranged a series of three faces, a sad-looking one, a neutral-looking one, and a happy-looking one. 

Varo notes that the Superintendent is now wholly engaged in Varo's every movement. A tentative smile reaches the Superintendent's face, with a questioning air. They also make eye contact with Varo for the first time in their interaction.

Varo gets the hint and presses their finger on the happy-looking face. Varo then scooped up the paper and turned to leave, unable to withstand the Superintendent's rictus any longer.

On the street, the parchment became a bit difficult to read. The sun being out and the sky being clear normally made for a lovely day Varo couldn't complain about. They were annoyed that they now had a reason to complain. 

The parchment is an awkward size, a bit too big for them to hold in one hand but a bit too small when held in two. It has a few words on it, another smiling animal, and a big green square. Press to start, Varo thinks. Varo obliged, and the page rearranged itself. Animated pictures mimed picking up a loaf of bread, travelling, and dropping it off. More words scrolled onto and off of the paper before Varo could read them.

Varo wandered around for a while, unfamiliar with this city. They'd grown up somehwere else and only came to this place to sign up for the warlock thing. Eventually they found the baker, and obtained a loaf of bread.

The parchment was a bit more forthcoming about its destination, and a crabby person snatched the loaf out of Varo's hands as soon as they rounded the corner, barking a few words in a language Varo didn't know, then disappeared into a doorway. 

Thus went Varo's first few deliveries, taking a while to find the items in question, and taking a while to deliver them to a mildly irate customer. At the end of a few days, Varo awoke to find a few coins in a piece of folded paper next to them. They'd been sleeping in a common house among some number of other warlocks, found almost entirely by accident. The others also had folded paper near their heads.

Varo went out into the common room, and observed from a distance two parchment-bearing warlocks, poking at their sheets. 

"Barge?" one asks. "Why Barge? Dont wanna get murdered?"
