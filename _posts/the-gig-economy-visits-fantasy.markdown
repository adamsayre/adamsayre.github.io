# The Gig Economy Visits Fantasy

"So, you wanna be a warlock?" drones the Indoctrination Superintendent, whose title is only obvious because of a voluminous etching on the table between them and Varo. Varo doesn't know what it says, but assumes it says Indoctrination Superintendent.

Varo nods, not trusting themself to much speech today.

"Fine, just fine," the superintendent (whose name is still a mystery) slides a sheaf of papers across the way to Varo. "Read this and then let me know if you agree to it."

Varo is directed to a chair among a group against a wall. The entrance they had come through into this office was dark, grimy, and dripping with mysterious liquid. Precisely what one would expect when signing up to be a warlock. The office itself was clean, brightly lit, and dry of any liquid. 

Varo idly flipped through pages of the sheaf, which seemed a well-worn and yellowing around the edges sort of sheaf. Words like "indemnity" and "arbitration" and "coaxial" floated up towards them from the page, and floated right on past, deflected by Varo's incomprehension of this language.

They take a moment to watch the goings on of the office. A few people come in, dropped pieces of paper on the Superintendent's desk, and a few others come and take other papers away. The Superintendent seems to be largely unaware of these papers, engrossed instead in a page that glows with a soft light towards their face. 

After a few dozen minutes of paper comings and goings, Varo concludes they're largely useless. They're pretty sure they saw a few of the same papers twice, maybe three times. Varo also concludes that they've spent enough time "reading" the sheaf and can reapproach the Superintendent, who nods at them, retrieves the sheaf, and presents Varo with the glowing paper they were working on before.

"If you agree to the terms presented in the document, sign your name or make your mark here" the Superintendent points at a line at the bottom of the page. Varo does, and the signs and symbols on the sheet rearrange themselves into a more recognizable form, or at least some of them do.

"Choose your preferred written language," drones the Superintendent, eyes deep in another glowing paper. 

Varo selects the one that they recognize most of the letters of. They'd been speaking a common enough tongue, but written language was a world all of its own. 

The page rearranged again to say Welcome, new Wanlock! A large-eyed smiling animal grins from behind the words. Varo doesn't recognize it. Varo's also only mostly sure what the words say, most words have a nasty habit of swimming together in their eyes.

"Thank you for your service, please make sure to provide a review of your experience on the next page," the Superintendent reaches across the table and brushes the parchment. 

Please rate your satisfanication with the indarctrination services by (and then a string of characters Varo doesn't recognize). Below are arranged a series of three faces, a sad-looking one, a neutral-looking one, and a happy-looking one. 

Varo notes that the Superintendent is now wholly engaged in Varo's every movement. A tentative smile reaches the Superintendent's face, with a questioning air. They also make eye contact with Varo for the first time in their interaction.

Varo gets the hint and presses their finger on the happy-looking face.

They then scoop up the paper and turn to leave, unable to withstand the Superintendent grinning any longer.

On the street, the parchment became a bit difficult to read. The sun being out and the sky being clear normally made for a lovely day Varo couldn't complain about. They were annoyed that they now had a reason to complain.

Varo hastens to the shade, the better to read. 

The parchment is an awkward size, a bit too big for them to hold in one hand but a bit too small when held in two. It has a few words on it, another smiling animal, and a big green square. Press the greem sqware to start yow shift. Varo obliged, and the page rearranged itself. Go to the baker marked on the map and pick up a loaf of bread.

Varo wandered around for a while, unfamiliar with this town. They'd grown up somehwere else and only came to this place to sign up for the warlock thing.
