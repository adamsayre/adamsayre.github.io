# Who's a Coward and Who's Brave?

When gods invade your homeland and slowly crush your people under their boots, when is the time right to rebel?

When big problems are laid in front of you, is it hard to grapple with them or hard to not? 

Is love a weakness? Or the thing that makes us human?

A parting thought: do we all believe our parents' lives were in halcyon days? Will our children look back on our times and find them simpler, desirable, somehow? Only time may tell.
