# Unreliable vs. Unrealistic

Alien Clay opens as the protagonist awakes in a decomposing one-way spacecraft, hurtling towards a prison planet with no escape. The main character, a scientist turned political dissident, fully intends to continue dissedenting and engaging in politics. All the while he researches the fascinating and science fictional biology of an ecosystem that differs from ours in a few very key ways. A good premise!

Tchaikovsky rewards us with some literary tropes that I think beneath him. The narrator conceals vital details from us, for most of the length of teh book, despite the narrative reading like he's talking directly to the reader. While an unreliable narrator is one thing, this borders on the unrealistic. He meets a character from his revolution days, and we don't find out they even know each other until after they make it somewhere private. It's a dramatic moment - meeting a tough-looking prisoner your first day inside the bars - but made worse in hindsight by the willful concealment of a fact that doesn't make the situation less dramatic. Under the watchful eye of the prison wardens two old co-conspirators have to pretend to meet for the first time and maintain their non-troublemaking personas until they reach somewhere private? Both have been told before, and Tchaikovsky doesn't land either one.

It reads more like watching a movie that's heavily narrated than it does reading a book.

The science-fictional elements are where the book really shines. As with his other works, Tchaikovsky is unafraid to posit an entire biosphere and its inner workings in a way that seems reasonable enough. I'm no biologist, and it holds up enough to be entertaining. What more can I ask? Perhaps the biologists or researchers should stay away from this one, if they hadn't been scared off by his arachnid-focused earlier work. 

Overall it read well, I didn't have to try very hard to finish. The human bits of the plot left a lot to be desired, but the alien plots were great.
