Review originally posted on Goodreads

I often wonder how she got away with such an engaging story when a good portion of it is people sitting around having tea.

That said - the stuff they talk about over tea is pretty heavy and interesting. I don't think a lot of Sci-Fi is as interested in the morals of its own society quite as much as the Radch series. Or, at least, I've never seen characters discussing the social issues of their society quite as much as in this book. Which doesn't mean it's boring, right? One aspect of our own society is that we often sit around over drinks and discuss the state of the world. And some of us are as anxious as Breq is about saying the right thing, and some of us are as actually literally involved in politics as much as Breq.

Maybe this book doesn't translate well to an online discourse. Discussing politics over drinks with people you care about talking to again (or don't, but are people in front of you nonetheless) is a different experience than tweeting about it.
