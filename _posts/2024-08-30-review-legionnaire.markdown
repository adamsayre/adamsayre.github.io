# Definitely pro-military military SF book

Or:

# Good pulp, but definitely still pulp, and probably fascist pulp

Kind of funny to portray it that way, but it's one of the most unquestioningly pro-military books I've read. Right up there with Heinlin's end of the political spectrum of a military-only government - I half expected a main character's dad to come out of the woodwork to join the Legion because they're just SO MANLY HUURGH

At one point the book (maybe this one, maybe later in the series) decries the political establishment as "woke" and too accepting, which definitely got too modern-day political for me. Wild to use such a specific term coined by [black americans in 21st century Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke#:~:text=The%20phrase%20stay%20woke%20was,and%20identities%20perceived%20as%20marginalized) and posit that what's basically a completely different culture would develop it. I'm not even sure Galaxy's Edge is set in a universe that once contained earth? Even if it is, a spacefaring civilization has very little reason to hang on to such things, in my opinion. Really what's happening is it's a dog whistle (or a regular whistle, because it's not very subtle) to the kind of people this book is aimed at: unquestioning supporters of the military and far-right leaning Americans with a Kindle Unlimited subscription.

The Legion is everything the 19th century American military was trying to be: badass, well equipped, and poised for the insurgent enemy that Galaxy's Edge delivers. It's the identity and the reality that the American far right continues to cling to: America and its military are the only things standing between the world and descent into chaos. Furthermore, the enemy is always right around the corner, hiding among their mud huts and waiting to cap an innocent law abiding US Soldier, never mind that soldier and his country just bombed the shit out of their home. 

Yes the Kublarens are a thinly veiled metaphor for Afghani/Iraqi/what-have-you insurgents *de jour* that the ~~Americans~~Legion are fighting this time. The series moves on from that planet pretty quickly and I think draws a grudging respect from the authors around the sheer force of will and fanaticism that was brought against the Legion. But they have unaccountably great weapons and fighting skill! Ooo scary there's no way a backwards desert dwelling race of aliens could possibly develop something like guns! There *must* be someone behind it all!

They're good pulp fiction. I've read 5 of these and am halfway through the 6th. The pacing is great and I don't think there's much fat or anything to take out. The series progresses to some ludicrous places but overall it gets there in a believable way, so it's fine! 

It's dangerous for any group to think of themselves as unproblematic peace-bringers. These books are unchallenging to read if you're white, and American, and privileged, and pro-military, and interventionist. Which is apparently like 60% of America.
