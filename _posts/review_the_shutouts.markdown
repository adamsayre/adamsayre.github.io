This is a story about mothers and daughters, surviving. Though calling it about daughters excludes the non-binary character, so I suppose a better way to describe this is a story about mothers and their children surviving.

A mother escapes an exploitative dynamic after the men in charge warp it into something unrecognizable. Another mother escapes "paradise" after learning harsh truths, and wanders north in search of closure. A child survives the collapse of civilization, and tries to form community to survive. A child escapes an oppressive paradise, choosing instead to live in the much worse "real world."

Is the book taking a position on how much civilization we should take advantage of? It doesn't seem like it: though the city-bound characters are portrayed as pretty useless in the wilds they don't die immediately as a ham-fisted way to let us know the city-idiots won't survive in the new world order.

The climate and deteriorating natural environment is almost a character alongside the women and their daughters. It evolves adn changes, from mild (relatively speaking) to severe. That it progresses and changes so much within a few generations is shocking (to me, a climate layman). Another sci-fi book might've focused in on the "collapse" part of the climate catastrophe, but Korn doesn't in this one. The collapse happens largely off screen: even though several characters live through it, we only hear about it from them telling other characters and never see it "on screen". That's a good choice, the apocalypse genre has too many entries, and apocalypses seem far more silly when introduced as just the latest problem to overcome. Korn does well to demonstrate the seriousness - a hurricane shatters a small village, the heat is oppressive, the north is the only sanctuary from the nonsense.

That said, if the climate apocalypse gives you palpitations, probably best to stay away from this one. The world was well built enough to give me elevated blood pressure for a while after reading, and I'm definitely not the biggest climate worrier.

Another part that the book skillfully didn't focus on is the nascent conspiracy theory that the world's governments are suppressing scientific research to combat/survive the climate catastrophes. While I hope that isn't happening in today's world, it's a good response to how climate research feels ignored today. Though Korn strikes a hopeful note: the characters throughout value and trust scientific discovery and progress. Even after the "collapse of civilization," research continues and the book seems to be trying to convey that we should never stop researching, and never stop supporting scientists.

The Shutouts is heartwarming and encouraging. If so much humanity can survive the coming apocalypse, then it gives me hope.
