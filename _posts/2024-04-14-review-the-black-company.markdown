# Bad Guys(TM) Who Write Their Own History

Its a perfectly good story, this review is mostly a reaction to the other commentary (and the branding) that's sprung up around it. It's described as "boots-on-the-ground" military fantasy that's *Dark* but not grimdark, and it tells the story of soldiers who are Bad Guys and are winning/losing the war!

It's a "boots-on-the-ground" view of a typical big fantasy world war. Instead of hanging around with the Aragorns and Arwens of the world we hang around with the company medic for a small group or Rohirrim or whoever else. Notably the POV character is also the Company's Annalist and keeps the record of what the group did and why they did it. He eventually gets invited into the inner circle for his historians role, some of the other characters want the events recorded. So it starts out with the lonely foot soldiers but still ends up following the Aragorns because they're making the decisions and in all the momentous occasions 

It's *Dark and Also Dark and Also Grim* - to the point where it's commented upon by the narrator. He discusses how he whitewashes the history of the Company by omitting atrocities like rape and murder of civilians. It's a "realistic" component of warfare but I can't help but compare it to LotR where rape isn't touched on. It feels like in rejecting fantasy tropes perhaps we went too far. Or at least went so far as to alienate audiences that would rather not endure that in their fantasy.

This book has Bad Guys(TM). They turn a blind eye as above (some of them complaining while they do). But they're also mercenaries who Serve Whichever Master That Pays Them. Except when they don't? Everyone from the POV character to the Captain in charge wonder if theyre doing the right thing. If they're helping the right people. Some of it's from their own sense of self-preservation, wondering if they're working for a guy that'll get them all killed. Mostly it's the main character and I can't help but wonder if he's actually a Good Guy just with less backbone than a Real Good Guy.

Is the book also about working for the bad guys? Is it a Boots-on-the-groud perspective on a war? Is it the basis for all modern military fantasy (as it said on the cover of my edition)?
